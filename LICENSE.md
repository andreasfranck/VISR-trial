*** FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec ***

Copyright (C) 2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007  Josh Coalson

FLAC is comprised of several
components distributed under difference licenses.  The codec libraries
are distributed under Xiph.Org's BSD-like license (see the file
COPYING.Xiph in this distribution).  All other programs, libraries, and
plugins are distributed under the LGPL or GPL (see COPYING.LGPL and
COPYING.GPL).  The documentation is distributed under the Gnu FDL (see
COPYING.FDL).  Each file in the FLAC distribution contains at the top the
terms under which it may be distributed.
Since this particular file is relevant to all components of FLAC,
it may be distributed under the Xiph.Org license, which is the least
restrictive of those mentioned above.  See the file COPYING.Xiph in this
distribution.
