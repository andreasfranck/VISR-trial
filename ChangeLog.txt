Patch release 0.11.5
--------------------

* Updated loudspeaker configuration files for BS-2051 configs and BBC BRIR data sets.
* Added Python functions for documentation generation.
* Documentation: Added VISR_BST documentation, moved loudspeaker config description to separate chapter.
* FIX: GitLab-CI configuration: Caching problems

Patch release 0.11.4
--------------------

* FIX: Fixed package generation if BUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT is deactivated.
* FIX: Activated native Jack audio interface support on GitLab-CI for Linux and Mac OS X.
* Cleaned up GitLab-CI configuration, worked around caching problem.

Patch release 0.11.3
--------------------

* FIX: Resolved problem with Python3.7 on Mac OS X (Bug #24 Python 3.7 support on Mac OS faulty).
  through updating Pybind11 to version 2.2.4
* FIX: Fixed BBC BRIR loudspeaker configuration files (duplicated labels for system G, center speaker M+000 missing in most configurations)
* Provide mechanism to export the used Python version a a target property.
* FIX: panning::LoudspeakerConfig: Made 3rd coordiante of loudspeaker positions optional if dimension==2.
* New Python-based loudspeaker configuration generation function in Python.
* Replaced loudspeaker configurations for the BBC BRIR dataset in visr_bst and the BS-2051 configs
  in $VISR/config/generic.
* Updated Gitlab CI configuration (build Python-free "core" version as well).

Patch release 0.11.2
--------------------

* Change RPATH handling to allow easier manipulation in Mac OS installers, especially from externals projects.
* This makes Python externals on MacOS unusable in local builds, they have to be installed.
* Mac OS installer searches for system-wide installations of the Anaconda Python distibution and Python 3 installed through HomeBrew.
* Updated documentation for python_runner standalone application

Patch release 0.11.1
--------------------

* Added libboost_atomic to installed 3rd-party libraries (formal dependency of libboost_thread)
* Fixed problems in Gitlab-CI configuration, provide support for Ubuntu 18
* User documentation for standalone applications

Version 0.11.0
==============

* Added sphinx-based user documentation (userdoc) and code reference documentation (apidoc)
* Added GitLab CI configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml) for continuous integration and deployment.
* Component-based installers for Windows and Mac OS X (based on PKG / ProductBuild )
* Fixing of Python rpaths in Mac OS X during installation.
* Cleaned up CMake target dependencies to reduce shared library dependencies (especially for Python)
* Link standalone applications to shared libraries.
* Changed defines VISR_<LIB>_STATIC_LIBRARY for libraries: define is now necessary when using the static 
  variant instead of the shared (automatically done by CMake exported targets).
* Added metadapter code to repo (as git subtree)

Version 0.10.0
==============

- Brought prototypical_restructuring branch into main development line
- Established gitflow versioning and release management scheme
- Support CMake target exporting

Version 0.8.2
=============

- Baseline renderer: Implemented object equalisation (activated vie --object-eq-sections or -e with argument > 0)

Version 0.8.1
=============

- Baseline renderer: Provide option NATIVE_JACK for using the native jack audio driver
- Matrix convolver: Renamed audio backend option "JACK" to JACK_NATIVE for consistency.

Version 0.8.0
=============

- First implementation of ChannelObject objects.
- First implementation of HOA (Higher-Order Ambisonics) rendering using AllRAD.
  * Hitherto developed in the hoaSourceObject
  * Debugging and evaluation not complete yet, but no detrimental influence on other rendering techniques expected.
- Impemented central versioning scheme for project.
  * Possibly this will be refined by moving the implementation (version amcros and strings) into a separate file.
