Changelog for project VISR


Version 0.8.0
=============

- First implementation of ChannelObject objects.
- First implementation of HOA (Higher-Order Ambisonics) rendering using AllRAD.
  * Hitherto developed in the hoaSourceObject
  * Debugging and evaluation not complete yet, but no detrimental influence on other rendering techniques expected.
- Impemented central versioning scheme for project.
  * Possibly this will be refined by moving the implementation (version amcros and strings) into a separate file.
