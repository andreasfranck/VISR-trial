Using VISR with Python

Using VISR audio workstation plugins
------------------------------------

Using Max/MSP externals
-----------------------


Extending VISR
==============

In this part we describe how to use the VISR framework to implement new functionality, i.e., functionality that is not contained in the existing components or standalone renderers.
This part is basically an extended version of the tutorial presented in 


Creating signal flows from existing components in Python
--------------------------------------------------------

Writing atomic functionality in Python
--------------------------------------

Implementing atomic components in C++
-------------------------------------

Creating composite components in C++
------------------------------------

Object-Based Audio with VISR
============================

Overview
--------

Although the VISR framework is deliberately application-agnostic, it is well-suited for working with spatial and object-based audio.


The VISR object model
---------------------

Predefined object-based rendering primitives and renderers
----------------------------------------------------------

Object-Based Reverberation
--------------------------

VISR component reference
========================

Standard rendering component library
------------------------------------

Binaural synthesis toolkit
--------------------------

Dynamic range control library
-----------------------------
