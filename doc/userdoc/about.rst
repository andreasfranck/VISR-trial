About
===========================

The VISR framework is a collection of software for audio processing that forms the backbone for most of the technology created in S3A. In this extensible software framework, complex audio algorithms can be formed by interconnecting existing building blocks, termed components. 

It can be used either interactively in the Python language, in custom applications (for instance in written C++, or integrated into other applications, for instance as DAW plugins or Max/MSP externals). While the VISR provides several renderers and building blocks for spatial and object-based audio, it is nonetheless a generic audio processing framework that can be used in other applications, for example array processing or hearing aid prototypes. The Python integration makes the system accessible, and enables easy algorithm development and prototyping.
